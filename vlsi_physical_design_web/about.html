                <h2>Site Purpose and Audience</h2>
                <p>VLSI Physical Design Hub is built as an educational reference for students, early-career engineers, and anyone transitioning into ASIC backend design. The goal is to explain core concepts such as synthesis, floorplanning, placement, CTS, routing, timing, and signoff using clear language and practical examples instead of only tool-specific commands.</p>
                <p>Most pages are organized so readers can learn a concept quickly and then connect it to the full implementation flow. That makes the site useful for interview preparation, semester projects, and self-study when you need a fast refresher before working on a block or reviewing a design report.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="scroll-reveal">
                <h2>How the Content Is Structured</h2>
                <p>Each article focuses on a specific physical design topic and links to related stages so you can move through the flow in sequence. The intent is to keep the material readable while still using the terminology that appears in real EDA tools and signoff discussions.</p>
                <p>References are collected in the Works Cited page so sources remain transparent. As the site grows, blog posts and project pages can be used to add case studies, debug stories, and practical implementation notes that complement the concept pages.</p>
                <p>The long-term plan for this site is to keep building a practical learning path for VLSI physical design by connecting theory pages with worked examples. That includes short concept summaries, deeper technical notes, and project-oriented explanations that help readers understand not only what each stage does, but also how decisions in one stage influence timing, congestion, power integrity, and signoff quality in later stages.</p>
